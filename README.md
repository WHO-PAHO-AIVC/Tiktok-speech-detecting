### Files

`configs.json`: before running the code on YOUR Mac/PC, change the directories in this file

**Directories to be changed**:

- `mp4_data_path`: path to the folder that has the mp4 files that need conversion to audio
- `save_path_wav`: path to folder that will store the converted mp4 audio files
- `save_path_txt`: path to the folder that will store the transcripts txt files

**Example**:

```
{
  "mp4_data_path": "C:\Users\John\Desktop\project_files\mp4_videos",
  "save_path_wav": "C:\Users\John\Desktop\project_files\wav_files",
  "save_path_txt": "C:\Users\John\Desktop\project_files\text"
}

```
